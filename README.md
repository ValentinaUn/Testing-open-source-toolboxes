# Testing-open-source-toolboxes

These are supplementary files for the bioRxiv preprint "Comparing open-source toolboxes for processing and analysis of spike and local field potentials data". The aim of these MATLAB scripts is to test and compare functionality of major open-source toolboxes for spike and local field potentials (LFPs) data analysis and processing.
